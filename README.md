## *Steps to run the simulation*

1.  Try it at https://ankitvig.github.io/CDWeb--3.0/ 
2.  The simulation logs are available in the logs folder.
3.  As in WebViewer- 3.0, we mainly focus on the visualization of Classic DEVS Models.So, we here consider an example of ABP DEVS model. The simulation logs is available in the folder : https://github.com/AnkitVig/CDWeb--3.0/tree/master/log/ABP
4.  The SVG file required to visualize the DEVS Diagram is also available in folder https://github.com/AnkitVig/CDWeb--3.0/tree/master/log/ABP
5.  The .log and .ma files are dropped as input to load the simulation into the WebViewer Dashboard.
6.  Successful Uploading of these files, will enable the "Load Simulation" button. Click the button to load the simulation.
7.  To Visualise DEVS Diagram, select DEVS Diagram Widget and click Load.
8.  On loading DEVS Diagram Widget, user will be asked to upload the SVG file. Upload the SVG file and click "Continue".
9.  The DEVS Diagram will be loaded in the WebViewer, user can now visualise the simulation results through Playback. 
10. Setting can be configured as per preference or requirement through control widget.
11. To view State Frequency Chart, enter the states to be monitored, click "Continue". The states will be represented in form of a bar graph.
12. To view Model Tracking Chart, select the models from DEVS Diagram to be monitored.
