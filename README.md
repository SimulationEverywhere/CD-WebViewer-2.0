The final integrated version (current version) of the application: [ARS Simulation Viewer](https://simulationeverywhere.github.io/CD-WebViewer-2.0/index.html)

How to use the tool?


- Visit the [Generic DEVS WebViewer](https://kaushalnavneet.github.io/WebViewer-3.0/) tool 
- Get ready with the simulation files. (Download folder of any model from ./log/ folder)
- Upload the simulation files from the downloaded log folder
- Click on *Load Simulation* button
- Based on the DEVS model type, it will show the visualization options to select from Widget
- Visualize and Analyze the simulation results 

>To visualize the Simulation of Classic-DEVS Model, please use the integrated version. Upload the files of ABP model from the log folder. And follow the same steps as above. The log files can be downloaded from any of the Github repositories mentioned below.

>The source code of the viewer is available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere/CD-WebViewer-2.0). The same source code is available under [DEV-Navneet branch](https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere/CD-WebViewer-2.0/tree/DEV-Navneet) of the Advanced Real-time Simulation Laboratoryâ€™s GitHub page. The final integrated version is available at ARS Lab's [GitHub Page](https://github.com/SimulationEverywhere/CD-WebViewer-2.0).
